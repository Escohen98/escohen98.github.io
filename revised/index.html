my Fraternity website. It also has a title of my Fraternity with an
image background, a quote, a donate button and my Fraternity's mission
statement. It also has a footer noting that the website is copyrighted.

        <p>
          <span>The mission of <em class="ZetaBT">Zeta Beta Tau</em> Fraternity
            (ZBT) is to foster and</span>
          <span>develop in its membership the tenets of its Credo:
            Intellectual</span>
          <span>Awareness, Social Responsibility, Integrity and Brotherly</span>
          <span>Love, in order to prepare its members for positions of</span>
          <span>leadership and service within their communities.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish
            </span>
          <span>Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its
            relationships</span>
          <span>within the Jewish community. Since 1954, ZBT has been</span>
          <span>committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and</span>
          <span>values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit
            and</span>
          <span>initiate men of good character, regardless of
            religion, race or</span>
          <span>creed who are accepting of these principles.</span>
