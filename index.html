This is the index.html page for my portfolio of web development work.
It includes a navigation bar that links to other pages for
my Fraternity website. It also has a title of my Fraternity with an
image background, a quote, and my Fraternity's mission statement.
It also has a footer noting that the website is copyrighted. The website
is not yet copyrighted; however, I plan hope to do so after completing CSE 154.

        <p>The mission of <em id="ZetaBT">Zeta Beta Tau</em> Fraternity (ZBT)
           is to foster and</p>
        <p>develop in its membership the tenets of its Credo: Intellectual</p>
        <p>Awareness, Social Responsibility, Integrity and Brotherly</p>
        <p>Love, in order to prepare its members for positions of</p>
        <p>leadership and service within their communities.</p>
        <p><br> </p>
        <p>Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish</p>
        <p>Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its relationships</p>
        <p>within the Jewish community. Since 1954, ZBT has been</p>
        <p>committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and</p>
        <p>values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit and</p>
        <p>initiate men of good character, regardless of religion, race or</p>
        <p>creed who are accepting of these principles.</p>
