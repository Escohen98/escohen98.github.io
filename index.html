This is the index.html page for my portfolio of web development work.
It includes a navigation bar that links to other pages for
my Fraternity website. It also has a title of my Fraternity with an
image background, a quote, a donate button and my Fraternity's mission
statement. It also has a footer noting that the website is copyrighted.

          The mission of <em id="ZetaBT">Zeta Beta Tau</em> Fraternity (ZBT)
           is to foster and
          <br><br>develop in its membership the tenets of its Credo:
                  Intellectual
          <br><br>Awareness, Social Responsibility, Integrity and Brotherly
          <br><br>Love, in order to prepare its members for positions of
          <br><br>leadership and service within their communities.
          <br><br>
          <br><br>Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish
          <br><br>Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its relationships
          <br><br>within the Jewish community. Since 1954, ZBT has been
          <br><br>committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and
          <br><br>values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit and
          <br><br>initiate men of good character, regardless of
                  religion, race or
          <br><br>creed who are accepting of these principles.
