          Student Life, the major system, and transparency with the student body
           are three aspects that this school<br> severely lacks. Student Life is a
           major aspect of every university in the country. UW is known as a<br>
           commuter school, and I want to change that culture. Not only that,
           but the major system is also broken.<br> If elected, I will invest resources
           into student engagement, alleviate the stress of the major system, and<br>
           increase transparency to students.
          <br><br>
          I have been a part of many student clubs on campus, so I know what it's
          like to be in a group of people<br> who want to share their passions.
          I am currently serving as the Esports Coordinator for the<br>
          Gaming Association at UW, I am the Internal Vice President and
          Operations Director for Zeta Beta Tau,<br> I played on our club Ultimate
          Frisbee team, and I founded the Rocket League club before I even began<br>
          attending UW. Throughout my time in all these organizations, I saw how
          much club culture can empower<br> and inspire. I want to bring that to the
          rest of the school.
          <br><br>
          I have spoken to many students and I have listened to their concerns.
          I know what students want and<br> what they do not. Here is what I plan
          to accomplish:
          <br>
          <div id="to-white">
          <ul>
            <li>Work with the Director of Legislative affairs to increase the
              Washington State Financial aid budget</li><br>
            <li>Ensure that the online learning tools that have been introduced
              in spring quarter are to be<br> utilized once in-person classes
              resume and improve the accessibility of our classes.</li><br>
            <li>Grow the marginalized communities on campus with the Director of
              Diversity Affairs by ensuring<br> that every student is represented.</li><br>
            <li>Work with the Director of University Affairs and the Provost
              Advisory Committee for Students<br> to create a more holistic major
              application process.</li><br>
            <li>Empower the UW Discord and /r/udub subreddit with ASUW resources
               and work with them to<br> serve as new channel of communications and to
                strengthen the online community for UW students</li><br>
            <li>Bring UW into broadcasting space on YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook
               to create fun and<br> entertaining content that also informs students
                on what is happening at the school.</li><br>
            <li>Work with the Director of Programming and Director of Community
              Relations to restructure the<br> RSO system to give individual clubs
              and students more of a voice. </li><br>
            <li>Create more engagement opportunities with ASUW officers for the
              public, such as weekly<br> community game nights and seasonal panels. </li><br>
            <li>Move the UWPD off-campus boundary from 45th to 47th or even 50th.</li><br>
            <li>Repave the streets in the Greek System</li>
          </ul><br>
          <br>
          I have spent my time at this school making changes for the better, and
          I promise to continue to improve<br> the school as your ASUW President!
