          Student Life is a major aspect of every university in the country.
          This school is known as a commuter school,<br> and I want to change
          that culture. This starts with investing resources. Other schools have
          significantly<br> invested in improving student engagement, and we should
          do the same. The University of Oregon<br> has hammocks and beach
          volleyball pits scattered around their campus. The University of
          British Columbiaâ€™s<br> student nest offers resources for any club to succeed.
          <br><br>
          I have been a part of many student clubs on campus. I am currently
          serving as the Esports Coordinator<br> for the Gaming Association at UW,
          I am the Internal Vice President and Operations Director for Zeta Beta
          Tau,<br> I played on our club Ultimate Frisbee team, and I founded my own
          club, WGA Rocket League before<br> I even began attending college, while
          currently serving as their president.
          <br><br>
          I have spoken to many students and I have listened to their concerns.
          I know what students want and<br> what they do not. Here is what I plan
          to accomplish: 
          <br>
          <div id="to-white">
          <ul>
            <li>Work with the Director of Legislative affairs to increase the Washington State Financial aid budget</li><br>
            <li>Ensure that the online learning tools that have been introduced
              in spring quarter are to be<br> utilized once in-person classes
              resume and improve the accessibility of our classes.</li><br>
            <li>Ensure that the online learning tools that have been introduced
               in spring quarter are to be<br> utilized once in-person classes resume
               and improve the accessibility of our classes.
            <li>Work with the Director of University Affairs and the Provost
              Advisory Committee for Students<br> to create a more holistic major
              application process.</li><br>
            <li>Absorb the UW Discord and /r/udub subreddit into ASUW entities
              to use as a new channel of<br> communications and to strengthen the
              online community for UW students</li><br>
            <li>Utilize the UW Twitch streaming channel to create fun and
              entertaining content that also<br> informs students on what is
              happening at the school.</li><br>
            <li>Work with the Director of Programming and Director of Community
              Relations to restructure the<br> RSO system to give individual clubs
              and students more of a voice. </li><br>
            <li>Transform Coffee with Kelty into Game with Eric where students
              can come talk to me and play<br> video games in the Esports Arena. </li>
          </ul><br>
          <br>
          I have spent my time at this school making changes for the better, and
          I promise to continue to improve<br> the school as your ASUW President!
